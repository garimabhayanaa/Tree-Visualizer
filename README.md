# Tree-Visualizer  

## Overview  
**Tree-Visualizer** is a web-based tool that allows users to input an array of numbers and visualize its transformation into different tree structures. Users can choose from sorting and visualizing the data into **Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree (BST), Min Heap,** or **Max Heap** formats.  

## Features  
- **Array Input:** Users can enter a custom array of numbers.  
- **Tree Visualizations:** Converts the array into various tree structures:  
  - Binary Tree  
  - Binary Search Tree (BST)  
  - Min Heap  
  - Max Heap  
- **Sorting & Processing:** The tool sorts and organizes the data based on the selected tree structure.  
- **Interactive Display:** A graphical representation of the selected tree structure is provided.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Visualization Library:** D3.js (or any other relevant library used for rendering trees)  

## Installation  

### Prerequisites  
- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)  
- (Optional) A local development server like **Live Server** for testing  

### Steps  
1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Tree-Visualizer
2. **Open the index.html file in a browser.**
- Alternatively, you can use a local server for better performance:
  ```bash
  npx live-server
3. Interact with the Application:
- Enter an array of numbers.
- Select the desired tree visualization.
- View the sorted and structured tree representation.

##Usage
1. **Input an Array**: Type or paste a list of numbers into the array input field.
2. **Choose a Tree Type**: Select from Binary Tree, BST, Min Heap, or Max Heap.
3. **Visualize**: Click the visualize button to generate the tree structure.

##Future Enhancements
- Implement animations for tree transformations.
- Allow users to insert/delete nodes dynamically.
- Support additional tree types like AVL Trees and Red-Black Trees.
